# Text Generator

Project page: https://hyperskill.org/projects/134


## About
Machine learning is getting crazy smart these days. You've probably read texts or scripts written by machine learning algorithms, some of them even mimicking styles of certain people! If you ever wondered how it works and what are the secrets behind machine learning, this project is for you! You will have a chance to understand and implement a simple text generator using Markov chains.
## Learning outcomes
You will create a program that can predict the next word in a pseudo-sentence based on the previous words in the sequence and the data that is used to create a statistical model. You will get a deeper understanding of natural language processing, string operations, and the application of statistics in your code.
## Remarks
Training data is based on the full script of Games of Thrones(corpus.txt). Markov chain analysis based on weighted prediction analysis for the word following bigram is used. Lines are intentionally kept short, after five words if a word ends in sentence ending character it's used to end the current sentence.


**Sample generated text:**
```txt
Do those people have bled enough.
The sound of a humorless mute.
Priest gave you the order?
Commander anymore. SNOW takes the reins in his chambers.
â€œNo, but I have been told as much as heard you were a golden lion.
That doesn't make us family.
The outer gate won't hold.
Saved me? Three of those little fish.
There isn't. A man gets lonely at sea.
Grandmother, please. What have we all.

Trivial even. You want Shae, keep her.

Lord Imp's going to destroy your castles and burn the rest of the sheath of the House Stark, Lord of the poppy.
Flea Bottom. Under houses, stables, taverns.
Sam away. I'm not going to kill my brother?
Lord, cast your light upon this man, your Hand.
Mm, I think he's smart enough to speak to me why it is expected of you.
Expedition north? I always do.
Black when the White Walkers.
I do? When they castrated you, did they build it?

We fight for me? I don't weep for your own kind.
That happened once, weeks ago.
Shame how it works? It's a sealed scroll for the queen's proposal Slavery will never surrender the Northern houses Roose Bolton murdered my husband.
Lady Zuriff. Lady Zuriff in this regard.
The law is law, my lady.
We no longer that man.
Loyal service means telling hard truths.
Like flies. I hit 'em right where it is.
Red Waste and you are somewhere else?
Eleven men. Most of them will be happy to do something to you.
